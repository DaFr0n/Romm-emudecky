"""EmuDeck launch resolution — build a host-neutral launch command from a
resolved :class:`domain.shortcut_data.EmulatorInvocation` and the host's
launcher / RetroArch cores roots.

EmuDeck does not boot games through a single sandbox app the way RetroDECK
does. Each emulator has its own launcher script under
``<storagePath>/Emulation/tools/launchers/`` (e.g. ``pcsx2-qt.sh``,
``dolphin-emu.sh``, ``retroarch.sh``), and the launch command is the
launcher script path followed by the emulator's middle args and the ROM
path.

This module is pure: it takes the resolved roots (``launchers_path``,
``retroarch_cores_dir``) and the per-system launcher-script map as inputs
and emits a structured resolution. The adapter
(:mod:`adapters.emudeck_launchers`) supplies the roots; the existing
shortcut renderer (:func:`domain.shortcut_data.resolve_emulator_invocation`)
delegates here so every ``launch_options`` bake site uses one shared
resolver (the invariant of EmuDeck port plan §7).

The resolution carries a structured status so callers that need a
user-visible state (game-detail panel, launcher-missing banners) get
``needs_setup`` / ``launcher_missing`` instead of a silently-empty string.
The shortcut-bake path consumes ``launch_options`` only.

# must configure an emulator) from "emulator resolved but its launcher script
# is missing on disk" (launcher_missing — EmuDeck is half-installed or the SD
# card ejected). See EmuDeck port plan §6 fallback order.
