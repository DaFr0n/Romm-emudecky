    launch-options prefix. The payload carried depends on ``kind``:

    - ``kind == "libretro"`` → ``core_so`` is the BARE core name (no ``.so``); the
      resolver emits the RetroArch ``-L <coresdir>/<so>.so %ROM%`` form.
    - ``kind == "standalone"`` → ``command`` is the full ES-DE ``<command>`` text
      (already ending in ``%ROM%``).
    - ``kind == "direct"`` → the folder-boot form (ADR-0019): ``command`` is the
      same full ES-DE standalone command AND ``launcher`` is the emulator's
      sandbox launcher path.

    ``label`` is the ES-DE display label (diagnostics only). This is the
    standalone-emulator seam (#129); read-path consumers that only understand
    libretro keep reading ``core_so`` (``None`` for a standalone or direct
    emulator) and degrade exactly as they do for a ``(None, None)`` resolution.
